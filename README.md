# Summary

This mini-program was inspired by my mother's suffering with her bank's site. She use to compare the card tickets with the movements registered in the bank, but she is not a techie and the site has a very short timeout before closing the session, so she has to login about 5 times before getting tired (and angry) or finishes checking. The way it tries to help her is downloading the movements in Excel files, so she can take the needed time to check them without any stress.

The plan is to add code to join the 3 Excel files and some little UI, so the program deletes all the files when she finishes. And later, probably to improve it through webscrapping and UI, so she wont need even Excel.
