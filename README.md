# Summary

This mini-program was inspired by my mother's suffering with her bank's site. She use to compare the card tickets with the movements registered in the bank, but she is not a techie and the site has a very short timeout before closing the session, so she has to login about 5 times before getting tired (and angry) or finishes checking. The way it tries to help her is downloading the movements in Excel files, so she can take the needed time to check them without any stress.

I used Selenium for navigating through the bank's site. I'm planning to later join the 3 Excel files, still to be decided if using Pandas or Openpyxl. I'll be updating this README as I go adding code.
